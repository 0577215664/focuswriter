  <description>
    <p>FocusWriter is a simple, distraction-free word processor. It utilizes a hide-away interface that you access by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, allowing the program to have a familiar look and feel to it while still getting out of the way so that you can immerse yourself in your work.</p>
    <p>FocusWriter allows you to customize your environment by creating themes that control the font, colors, and background image to add ambiance. It also features on-the-fly updating statistics, daily goals, multiple open documents, spell-checking, and much more.</p>
    <p>Additionally, when you open the program your current work in progress will automatically load and position you where you last left off so that you can immediately jump back in.</p>
